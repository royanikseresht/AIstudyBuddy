# Text Summarizer App

The **Text Summarizer App** is a web application that allows users to input large chunks of text and receive summarized versions in various lengths: short, medium, or detailed. This app uses a powerful summarization API (powered by Python) to generate concise summaries based on the input text, helping users save time when working with lengthy documents or articles.

## About the App

The **Text Summarizer App** allows users to quickly and easily generate summaries of any text. The app provides three options for summary length:
- **Short**: A brief summary that captures the key points.
- **Medium**: A more detailed summary covering important sections.
- **Detailed**: A thorough summary with more detailed information.

The app leverages the `summarize` endpoint of a backend API to analyze the provided text and return the desired summary.

### How it works:
1. The user inputs text into the frontend form.
2. The frontend sends a POST request to the backend API with the text and desired summary length.
3. The backend processes the text using Python-based summarization logic and returns the summary.
4. The frontend displays the summary for the user to view.

---

## Features

- **Text Input**: Users can input large amounts of text and choose the desired summary length.
- **Dynamic Summarization**: Based on the chosen length (short, medium, or detailed), the app returns a corresponding summary.
- **Real-time Feedback**: While the summary is being generated, the app displays a "Summarizing..." message to keep the user informed.
- **Responsive UI**: The app is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across devices.

---

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structure of the app.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout. The app uses responsive design principles to ensure it works on both mobile and desktop.
- **JavaScript**: Used for the dynamic behavior and interacting with the backend API. It handles form submissions and displays the summary result.
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)**: For clean, modern typography.
- **Favicon**: Custom image for the tab icon.

### Backend
- **Python**: The backend uses Python, specifically Flask, for API development. Python handles the text summarization logic.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for building the backend API that processes the summarization requests.
- **Summarization Algorithm**: The app uses a Python-based natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to analyze the input text and generate the summaries.
- **Ngrok**: Used for tunneling the local server for testing purposes (or any similar service for deployment).

## Backend Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Steps to set up the backend:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royanikseresht/aistudybuddy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the backend folder**:
   
   If you have a separate backend folder, navigate to it. For example:
   
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment** (Optional but recommended):
   
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:
   
   The project relies on Flask for handling the API. You can install it with pip:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   pip install transformers  # NLP model for summarization
   pip install flask-cors  # If handling CORS requests for cross-origin support
   ```

5. **Create the Flask app**:

   In the `backend/` directory, create a file `main.py` (or another name) to set up the Flask API:

   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   from transformers import pipeline

   app = Flask(__name__)
   summarizer = pipeline("summarization")

   @app.route('/summarize', methods=['POST'])
   def summarize():
       data = request.get_json()
       text = data.get('text')
       length = data.get('length')

       if not text:
           return jsonify({"error": "No text provided"}), 400

       # Adjust summarization parameters based on length
       min_length = 50 if length == 'short' else 100 if length == 'medium' else 200
       max_length = 150 if length == 'short' else 250 if length == 'medium' else 350

       summary = summarizer(text, min_length=min_length, max_length=max_length)
       return jsonify({"summary": summary[0]['summary_text']})


   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

6. **Run the Flask app**:

   Start the backend server using the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   This will start the Flask server locally on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. If using Ngrok, run:

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

   This will give you a publicly accessible URL (e.g., `https://xxxxx.ngrok.io`) that the frontend can use to make requests.

## Frontend Setup

### Steps to set up the frontend:

1. **Clone the repository** (if not done already):

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/royanikseresht/aistudybuddy.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the frontend folder**:
   
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

3. **Open `index.html` in a browser**:
   
   You can simply open `index.html` using your browser to view and interact with the app.

4. **Link the frontend with the backend API**:

   Update the `script.js` file with the correct URL of the backend API (use the URL from Ngrok or your production backend URL):

   ```javascript
   const response = await fetch('https://xxxxx.ngrok.io/summarize', {  // Replace with your backend URL
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       body: JSON.stringify({ text, length }),
   });
   ```

## Installation

To run the **Text Summarizer App** locally, follow the steps for both the **backend** and **frontend** setups.

### Backend Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `backend/` directory.
2. Set up a Python virtual environment.
3. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Flask app using `python app.py`.

### Frontend Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `frontend/` directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

---

## Usage

1. **Enter Text**: Type or paste a large chunk of text into the text box.
2. **Choose Summary Length**: Select the desired summary length from the dropdown (Short, Medium, or Detailed).
3. **Summarize**: Click the "Summarize" button to generate the summary.
4. **View Summary**: After a few seconds, the summarized text will appear below the form.
